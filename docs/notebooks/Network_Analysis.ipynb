    "<h2>Why Network Analysis?</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Network Analysis offers a computational and quantitative means to examine and explore relational objects, with proxies to measure structural roles and concepts such as power and influence. Doing so digitally - and at scale - also allows us to consider these kinds of questions with large amounts of material or documents that was not  heretofore manageable with qualitative or manual approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't get into any core network theories or its uses in the humanities here, as we're focused on the ways in which network analysis in <i>kiara</i> offers an interesting way to wrap the research process, and think about the decisions we're making and how to trace them. If you're interested in learning more about network analysis, or how to code using <a href=\"https://networkx.org\">NetworkX</a>, the library currently used in these <i>kiara</i> modules, check out our recommended reading at the bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Getting Started</h3>\n",
    "<br>Let's start by double checking that we have all the required plugins and setting up an API for us to use <i>kiara</i>. We'll do this all in one go this time, but if you're unsure, feel free to head back to the <a href=\"http://dharpa.org/kiara.documentation/latest/workshop/workshop/\">installation notebook</a> to look over this section again."
